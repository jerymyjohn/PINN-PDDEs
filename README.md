# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Proportional Delay Differential Equations (PINN-PDDEs)

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Proportional Delay Differential Equations (PINN-PDDEs) â€“ a deep neural network framework designed to solve both forward and inverse problems related to proportional delay differential equations (PDDEs). This approach integrates proportional delay differential equations into neural networks, enabling the accommodation of diverse requirements such as initial conditions, control equations, and known data.
